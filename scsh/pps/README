The structure pps implements a portable version of the ps command. It
currently supports FreeBSD (4.6), Mac OS X/Darwin (10.2/6.3), Linux
(2.4.19), AIX (4.3.2), Solaris (SunOS 5.8) (tested version). As the ps
command is not part of any standard this package is likely to fail if
the version of your system differs from the one I tested. Please
report incompatible versions and, if possible, provide an adapted
version.
