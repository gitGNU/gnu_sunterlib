Scheme Untergrund Library

The Scheme Untergrund Library hosts contributed code for Scheme48 and
Scsh. In addition to acting as host, the project provides a
centralized way to access these packages from the languages' module
system.

Sunterlib is hosted at Savannah:

USE

To use sunterlib, first make sure the library is installed (see
INSTALL).

After installation, the library is available in
  /usr/local/lib/sunterlib,
and the documentation is available in
  /usr/local/share/doc/sunterlib
(or the corresponding subdirectories of the prefix used for
installation).

The file "sunterlib.scm" is the full sunterlib interface for use with
scsh ("sunterlib.scm" is composed of the deprecated "interfaces.scm"
and "packages.scm").

The file "sunterlib-s48.scm" is the sunterlib subset interface for use
with scheme48 ("sunterlib-s48.scm" is composed of the deprecated
"s48-interfaces.scm" and "s48-packages.scm").

A typical scsh script might start like this:

#!/usr/local/bin/scsh \
-lm /usr/local/lib/sunterlib/sunterlib.scm -o foo -s
!#

where "foo" is a sunterlib package needed by your script.
