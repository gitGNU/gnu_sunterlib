Scheme Untergrund Library

The Scheme Untergrund Library hosts contributed code for Scheme48 and
Scsh. In addition to acting as host, the project provides a
centralized way to access these packages from the languages' module
system.

Sunterlib is hosted at Savannah:
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/sunterlib/

USE

To use sunterlib, first make sure the library is installed (see
INSTALL).

After installation, the library is available in
  /usr/local/lib/sunterlib,
and the documentation is available in
  /usr/local/share/doc/sunterlib
(or the corresponding subdirectories of the prefix used for
installation).

The files "interfaces.scm" and "packages.scm", are the full sunterlib
for use with scsh.

The files "s48-interfaces.scm" and "s48-packages.scm", are a sunterlib
subset for use with scheme48.

A typical scsh script might start like this:

#!/usr/local/bin/scsh \
-lm /usr/local/lib/sunterlib/interfaces.scm -lm /usr/local/lib/sunterlib/packages.scm -o foo -s
!#

where "foo" is a sunterlib package needed by your script.
