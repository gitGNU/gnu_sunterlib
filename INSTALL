Scheme Untergrund Library

REQUIREMENTS

The Scheme Untergrund Library requires that scsh is installed on your
system. If you don't have it, please obtain and install it before
building sunterlib. See the webpage <http://scsh.net/>.

CONFIGURING SUNTERLIB

Sunterlib does not require configuration at this time. You may want to
adjust the Makefile's "prefix" variable to set the installation
directory.

BUILDING SUNTERLIB

Type 'make' to build the package.

INSTALLATION

Type 'make install' to install the package.

UNINSTALLATION

Type 'make uninstall' to uninstall the package.
