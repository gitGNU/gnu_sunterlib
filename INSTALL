Scheme Untergrund Library

REQUIREMENTS

The Scheme Untergrund Library requires that scsh is installed on your
system. If you don't have it, please obtain and install it before
building sunterlib. See the webpage <http://scsh.net/>.

BUILD

If you obtained the source from cvs, type 'make' to build the
package. This is not necessary if you have a tar distribution.

INSTALLATION

As of version 0.6, sunterlib follows Michel Schinz's scsh package
proposal for installation and use. Please see:
  scsh/scsh-packages/doc/latex/proposal.tex

The top-level installation script is install-pkg. It will install all
of the libraries.

TODO: install-pkg scripts for individual library subdirectories.

UNINSTALLATION

See the packaging proposal for details.
